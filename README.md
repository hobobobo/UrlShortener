Create a simple "URL shortener" PHP web application.   
The main (perhaps only) page would be simple form, where you put in the complete URL, 
and after submitting the website will give you shortlink URL. 
Then, if you use this short URL, you will be redirected to the original long URL   
For example, when I put in address 
"https://medium.com/@nykolas.z/dns-resolvers-performance-compared-cloudflare-x-google-x-quad9-x-opendns-149e803734e5" 
and it will give me URL "http://localhost/d8aj4s"  
When i open another tab and put in URL 
"http://localhost/d8aj4s", i should be redirected to URL 
"https://medium.com/@nykolas.z/dns-resolvers-performance-compared-cloudflare-x-google-x-quad9-x-opendns-149e803734e5"   
Store data in SQL database. Use your favorite PHP framework. The app needs to be ready for production (reasonably optimized, safe)   
The output is zipped source code with installation instructions (including SQL script for creating database schema)
